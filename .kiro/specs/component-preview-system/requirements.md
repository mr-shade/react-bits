# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Component Preview System will provide an interactive preview interface that allows developers to explore React Bits components with different prop configurations before installing them. This system will enhance the developer experience by providing real-time component customization, code generation, and installation commands, making it easier for developers to understand component capabilities and integrate them into their projects.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer browsing React Bits components, I want to interactively preview components with different prop configurations, so that I can understand how the component behaves before installing it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits a component page THEN the system SHALL display an interactive preview area with the component rendered using default props
2. WHEN a user modifies component props through controls THEN the system SHALL update the preview in real-time
3. WHEN a user changes prop values THEN the system SHALL validate the input and show appropriate error messages for invalid values
4. IF a component has multiple variants THEN the system SHALL provide a variant selector that updates the preview accordingly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer customizing a component, I want to see the generated code for my current configuration, so that I can copy the exact implementation I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user modifies component props THEN the system SHALL generate and display the corresponding JSX code
2. WHEN the user selects a different component variant (JS-CSS, JS-TW, TS-CSS, TS-TW) THEN the system SHALL update the generated code to match the selected variant
3. WHEN a user clicks the copy code button THEN the system SHALL copy the generated code to the clipboard
4. IF the component requires imports THEN the system SHALL include the necessary import statements in the generated code

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer who wants to install a component, I want to get the exact CLI command for my current configuration, so that I can quickly add the component to my project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a component preview THEN the system SHALL display the appropriate CLI installation command (shadcn or jsrepo)
2. WHEN a user selects a different component variant THEN the system SHALL update the CLI command to match the selected variant
3. WHEN a user clicks the copy command button THEN the system SHALL copy the CLI command to the clipboard
4. IF the component has dependencies THEN the system SHALL include dependency installation instructions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer exploring components, I want to see prop documentation alongside the preview, so that I can understand all available customization options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a component preview THEN the system SHALL display a props table with descriptions, types, and default values
2. WHEN a prop has predefined options THEN the system SHALL show those options in the documentation
3. WHEN a user hovers over a prop control THEN the system SHALL display additional help text or examples
4. IF a prop affects component behavior significantly THEN the system SHALL highlight this in the documentation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using the preview system, I want responsive preview options, so that I can see how components look on different screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a component preview THEN the system SHALL provide responsive breakpoint controls (mobile, tablet, desktop)
2. WHEN a user selects a different breakpoint THEN the system SHALL resize the preview area accordingly
3. WHEN the preview is resized THEN the system SHALL maintain component functionality and appearance
4. IF a component has responsive-specific props THEN the system SHALL allow configuration for different breakpoints

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer comparing components, I want to save and share specific component configurations, so that I can collaborate with team members or reference configurations later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures a component THEN the system SHALL provide a "Share Configuration" button
2. WHEN a user clicks share THEN the system SHALL generate a shareable URL that preserves the current configuration
3. WHEN a user visits a shared configuration URL THEN the system SHALL load the component with the saved prop values
4. WHEN a user bookmarks a configuration THEN the system SHALL maintain the configuration state in the URL parameters
