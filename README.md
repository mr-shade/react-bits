## About

React Bits is a library of animated and interactive React components designed to make your UI development faster and more engaging. From text animations to responsive layouts, React Bits has got you covered.

The main idea behind this project is to keep dependencies to a minimum and just offer code that you can plug into your projects without much hassle - this is why most components you will find here only use an animation library for smoother animations and shorter code and nothing else - the rest is up to you to customize according to your own needs.

## Key Features
- A variety of animated text and UI components
- Customizable and lightweight with minimal dependencies
- Designed to integrate seamlessly with any React project
