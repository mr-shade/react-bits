# React Bits

> The largest & most creative library of animated React components.

React Bits is an open-source collection of carefully designed UI components that aim to enhance your React web applications. This is not your typical component library - you won't find generic buttons, inputs, or common UI elements here. These components are designed to help you stand out and make a statement visually by adding creativity to your projects.

## Mission & Principles

The goal of React Bits is to provide flexible, visually stunning, and free components that take web projects to the next level, guided by these principles:

- **Free For All**: You own the code - it's free to use in your projects with full visibility
- **Prop-First Approach**: Easy customization through thoughtfully exposed props without diving into code
- **Fully Modular**: Install only what you need - React Bits is not a dependency
- **Free Choice**: JavaScript or TypeScript, plain CSS or Tailwind - all options available
