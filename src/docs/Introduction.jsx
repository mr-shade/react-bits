        React Bits is an open-source collection of carefully designed UI components that aim to enhance your React web applications.
      </p>
      <p className="docs-paragraph">
        This is not your typical component library, which means you won&apos;t find a set of generic buttons, inputs, or other common UI elements here.
      </p>
      <p className="docs-paragraph">
        Basically, these components are here to help you stand out and make a statement visually by adding a touch of creativity to your projects.
      </p>

      <h3 className="docs-category-title">Mission</h3>

      <p className="docs-paragraph dim">
        The goal of React Bits is simple - provide flexible, visually stunning and most importantly, free components that take web projects to the next level.
      </p>
      <p className="docs-paragraph">
        To make that happen, the project is committed to the following principles:
      </p>

      <ul className="docs-list">
        <li className="docs-list-item"><span className="docs-highlight">Free For All:</span> You own the code, and it&apos;s free to use in your projects</li>
        <li className="docs-list-item"><span className="docs-highlight">Prop-First Approach:</span> Easy customization through thoughtfully exposed props</li>
        <li className="docs-list-item"><span className="docs-highlight">Fully Modular:</span> Install strictly what you need, React Bits is not a dependency</li>
        <li className="docs-list-item"><span className="docs-highlight">Free Choice:</span> JS or TS, plain CSS or Tailwind, the code is all here</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 className="docs-category-subtitle">Free For All</h4>

      <p className="docs-paragraph">
        Every component you choose to bring into your project is yours to modify or extend, because you get full visibility of the code, not just an import.
      </p>

      <h4 className="docs-category-subtitle">Prop-First Approach</h4>

      <p className="docs-paragraph">
        Every component is designed to be flexible and customizable, with props that allow you to adjust the look and feel without having to always dive into the code.
      </p>

      <h4 className="docs-category-subtitle">Fully Modular</h4>

      <p className="docs-paragraph">
        React Bits is not your classic NPM library, you install only the components you need by either copying the code or using the CLI, without pulling in a whole library.
      </p>

      <h4 className="docs-category-subtitle">Free Choice</h4>

      <p className="docs-paragraph">
        I don&apos;t want to dictate how you build your projects. Whether you prefer JavaScript or TypeScript, plain CSS or Tailwind, it&apos;s all here for you to use as you see fit.
      </p>

      <p className="docs-paragraph dim">
        P.S. The header has a neat dropdown to help you choose your preferred language.
      </p>

      <h3 className="docs-category-title">Performance</h3>

      <p className="docs-paragraph dim">
        While we do everything possible to optimize components and offer the best experience, here are some tips to keep in mind when using React Bits:
      </p>

      <ul className="docs-list">
        <li className="docs-list-item"><span className="docs-highlight">Less Is More:</span> Using more than 2-3 components on a page is not advised, it can overload your page with animations, potentially impacting performance or UX</li>
        <li className="docs-list-item"><span className="docs-highlight">Mobile Optimization:</span> Consider disabling certain effects on mobile and replacing them with static placeholders instead</li>
        <li className="docs-list-item"><span className="docs-highlight">Test Thoroughly:</span> Your device may be high-end, but be considerate of your users - always test on multiple devices before going live</li>
      </ul>
